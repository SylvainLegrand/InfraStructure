# CHANGELOG OBLYON FOR [DOLIBARR ERP CRM](https://www.dolibarr.org)
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

### [3.7.0] - Compatibility 18.0.x - 24.0.x (2026/09/18)

### Added
- Seven colour tokens for elements that were hard-coded for a light background and became unreadable with a dark preset (audit of the instance preset infras-dark, 2026-09-18): OBLYON_COLOR_AMOUNT_TEXT (text of the amounts, span.amount, was #006666), OBLYON_COLOR_CAL_EVENT_TXT (text of the agenda events, whose background is the main colour, was #111111), OBLYON_COLOR_CAL_WEEKEND_BCKGRD and OBLYON_COLOR_CAL_HOLIDAY_BCKGRD (week-ends and days off of the timesheets and calendars, were #eee / #f4eede / #fdf6f2 ; the input of a day off takes the input background), OBLYON_COLOR_OVERLAY_BCKGRD (floating surfaces that were white: filter bar of the lists, modals, hovered entry of the columns selector, inline edit hover), OBLYON_COLOR_TOPMENU_BCKGRD_SEL and OBLYON_COLOR_TOPMENU_TXT_SEL (selected entry of the main menu, whose text was white whatever the preset ; the background defaults to the hover background). Offered on the Colors tab of the module (groups Top menu, General backgrounds, Amounts, new group Agenda / calendars) and on the Colors tab of the user card, seeded by data.sql, added to the seven preset files (version +1 ; the event text is white on the presets whose main colour is dark). New helper oblyon_color_setting_hex() (lib/oblyon_colors.lib.php): a token painted as a plain CSS colour falls back to its default when the value is not #RRGGBB
- Fifteen more colour tokens for the elements that stayed hard-coded for a light background: the nine status badge families OBLYON_COLOR_BADGE_DRAFT / VALIDATED / APPROVED / WAITING / ACTIVE / CLOSED / CANCELED / ERROR / DONE (background and border of the badges, replacing the fixed $badgeStatus* values of theme_vars.inc.php ; the badge text is no longer white or the row text according to the lightness but the dark or white candidate with the best WCAG contrast, oblyon_text_on() ; the closed / canceled badges keep a plain background whose text follows the same rule ; .font-statusN takes the status colour instead of the badge background, which was the row background for the border-only badges, so the coloured status texts were invisible), OBLYON_COLOR_STOCK_OK / STOCK_LOW / STOCK_EXIT (stock column of the product lines and stock movements), OBLYON_COLOR_ICON_TEXT (phone, mail, link, trash, play pictograms, the hovered trash takes the danger status colour), OBLYON_COLOR_TIMELINE_BCKGRD / TIMELINE_PRIVATE_BCKGRD (ticket timeline ; its texts, borders, buttons and icon circles follow the row text, border and neutral tokens). Groups Status badges, Stock and movements, Timeline (tickets) on both Colors tabs ; seeded by data.sql ; present in the seven preset files (dark tints on Night and on the instance dark preset) and checked by the contrast report (stock, pictograms, timeline). OBLYON_COLOR_FTITLE, not read by the theme since the migration to THEME_ELDY_TEXTTITLE, is removed from the preset files
- Without new tokens, on the existing ones: quick add dropdown texts (#444 on the page background), jQuery UI dialog and date picker header (#ccc), ECM layout panes (white), togglers and resizers, search tags, #tooltip text, DataTables length select, login info block, columns selector hints, timeline
- Contrast check of the presets and of the personal colours (oblyon_check_preset_contrast): 25 more couples as the theme paints them (main colour as file type icons and tab hover text with its own threshold 3, and as background of the agenda events, amounts on the rows, hovered / checked rows, notifications, natures, members, selected menu entry, floating surfaces, week-ends and days off, page title on the page background, date picker active day on the core top menu colour, dialogs on THEME_ELDY_BACKBODY), the 15 dashboard tiles (module colour as icon on the row background, or under a white icon when THEME_INFOBOX_COLOR_ON_BACKGROUND is on ; the dashboard section is read for that) and detection of the colour values the theme cannot read (e.g. 0.0.0 or 25.5.45: colorStringToArray() falls back to grey #585858 without any warning). New oblyon_contrast_issue_text() shared by the three reports (preset cards, user tab, user presets), new lang key OblyonPresetInvalidValue

### Changed
- Theme reorganisation, generated stylesheet unchanged (checked with the new dev/csscompare.php: 0 semantic difference, text identical apart from comments). (1) Deduplication of the 24 *.inc.php files: 160 identical copies of a rule (first occurrence removed, the later one already won the cascade), 22 earlier copies whose every property was overridden by a later copy, 31 dead declarations inside partially overridden copies, 30 empty rules, the 313 lines duplicated twice in the JMobile / POS / Public / cd-timeline sections, and the 250-line copy of the top bar section that login.inc.php carried since its creation and that, included later, defeated the fixes made in global.inc.php (.alogin:hover and div.login_block:hover:after took back the main colour, div.login a took the side menu text colour): login.inc.php now holds the login page only, its 8 rules without equivalent were moved to the top bar section, 4 hard-coded colours of that section (#f4f4f4, #fff, #444) take the tokens the removed copy already used. Rules that only add properties to an earlier one are kept. Rules containing PHP are never touched. (2) global.inc.php (11 000 lines) is split at its own section boundaries into core, tools, layout, cards, tables, widgets, public and fixes .inc.php, included in the original order; global.inc.php keeps the entry role, the historical includes and the conditional tail. (3) Every *.inc.php gets the same header after its guard (file, role, included by, rule "one rule, one place"); new CLI dev/csscompare.php compares two saved stylesheets on the final value of each property per selector
- Single storage format for the colours: '#RRGGBB'. The core "Display setup" pages (admin/ihm.php, user/param_ihm.php) still write 14 THEME_ELDY_* constants as 'r,g,b' and the old defaults of theme_vars.inc.php used that form; the module read them through colorStringToArray() and printed 20 CSS variables as rgb(r,g,b), the only place where that form survived (no rgba() composition depends on it). Now oblyon_color_setting() converts any 'r,g,b' value to hex (new oblyon_color_to_hex()), style.css.php normalizes the 20 Eldy colours to hex (oblyon_txt_color_hex() feeds txt_color()), global.inc.php prints them as is (the title link variable is built with colorHexToRgb()), the preset normalization and the current values read from the database convert 'r,g,b' to hex (so a preset compares equal to the database whatever the stored form), and the Colors tabs of the module and of the user card rewrite the stored 'r,g,b' values as hex when they open (oblyon_colors_normalize_stored(), idempotent, CSS revision bumped). 'r,g,b' stays accepted on input (import, user tab) but is never stored any more. Generated CSS unchanged (checked by diff after rgb -> hex normalization)
- Colors tab of the module: the colours stored in the database (not only the preset files) are checked, with the same report as the cards (couples below 4.5, values the theme cannot read such as 0.0.0)

### Fixed
- Hovered links of the menus and of the top bar (main menu label next to its hovered icon, side menu titles and entries, search / bookmarks / help blocks, company name, login link) took the main colour of the preset as text colour: with a main colour close to the hover background (Accessibility, Light, instance dark presets) the label vanished on hover. They now use the hover text tokens of their menu (OBLYON_COLOR_TOPMENU_TXT_HOVER / OBLYON_COLOR_LEFTMENU_TXT_HOVER, a '#' value still inherits the normal text colour)
- The six preset files pass the extended contrast check (0 warning): darker nature backgrounds under the white nature text (prospect #687A6D, customer #498050, vendor #477D8C), notification texts (warning #6B5A12, error #6B1A2E ; Blue keeps its inverted scheme with a #6B5A12 warning background and a #FFE4EA error text), date picker active day readable on the core top menu colour, Blue main colour #D9741F (was #E09430, 2.5 on white), Dark selected menu entry #006F8A, Night amounts in light tints ; the 16 dashboard tile colours, missing from the five historical presets (the database value stayed whatever the preset), are now part of every preset (Okabe-Ito set of the Accessibility preset on the light presets, light tints on Night) with THEME_INFOBOX_COLOR_ON_BACKGROUND = 0 and THEME_AGRESSIVENESS_RATIO = 0 so the colours are painted as stored
- Colors tab of the module: THEME_ELDY_TOPMENU_BACK1, THEME_ELDY_VERMENU_BACK1, THEME_ELDY_BACKBODY and THEME_ELDY_TEXTTITLELINK (read by the theme: date picker active day, select2 dropdowns, jQuery UI dialogs) were offered on the user tab only, so an invalid value written by the core "Display setup" page (0.0.0) could not be fixed from the module; new group "Other Dolibarr colours (Eldy theme)"
- en_US/oblyon.lang: 16 keys of 3.6.0 (Accessibility preset, user colours permission and user presets) existed in French only
- THEME_ELDY_LINEBREAK and THEME_ELDY_TEXTTITLELINK are now normalized like the other 'r,g,b' constants (style.css.php): a #RRGGBB value, the only form the Colors tab writes, was printed as is inside rgb() / rgba() and gave an invalid CSS variable (no border on hr)
- info-box.inc.php ignored THEME_AGRESSIVENESS_RATIO stored by the Dashboard tab and the presets and always used -50 for the dashboard tiles; the stored value is read, -50 stays the fallback when the constant is empty

### [3.6.0] - Compatibility 18.0.x - 24.0.x (2026/09/16)

### Added
- Presets as JSON files (Colors tab): the five color presets are now files of the module (presets/green.json, dark.json, blue.json, night.json, light.json, one file = one preset, converted from the former PHP array with a key by key check) and any instance can have its own presets in DOL_DATA_ROOT/[entity/]oblyon/presets. A preset carries optional sections, each with its white list of constants: colors, typography, menus, general, lists_cards, dashboard, custom_css (FontAwesome pack and security settings are excluded on purpose). Compact cards replace the thumbnails (the screenshot of the module for the five shipped presets, a drawing from the colors for instance presets): name (description and sections in the tooltip), small icons for the contrast warning, Download, Update this preset (instance preset that differs from the database) and Delete (instance presets only), then stacked buttons: Apply this preset (Discard the changes when the current preset differs from the database), Update this preset (instance preset that differs), Download, Delete (instance presets only); a preset is always applied, updated and saved as a whole; "Save as" creates an instance preset from every current setting (key with a help tooltip, displayed name, description), "Import" loads a JSON file (256 KB, same validation, key from the file name, optional replace); both forms are folded behind their title (native details element, no JS). Applying is one transaction (menus rules of the Menus tab replayed, OBLYON_CURRENT_PRESET stored, CSS revision refreshed); text / background couples below the WCAG 4.5 contrast are flagged on the card. New library lib/oblyon_presets.lib.php, new directory presets/, data directory oblyon/presets created at activation, constant OBLYON_CURRENT_PRESET (seeded to blue)
- Colours per user: new tab "Colors" on the user card (declared by the module descriptor, so the module must be disabled / enabled once to show it; a completeTabsHead hook puts it right after the core "Display setup" tab), laid out like the core "Display setup" tab: Parameter / Default value / "Use personal value" checkbox on the first row, then one row per colour of the theme (116 constants, grouped as in the Colors tab of the module plus the dashboard tiles and four Eldy colours that had no row before), greyed until the box is ticked. The user himself (user/self/write) or an administrator / user manager (user/user/write) can edit; reading someone else's tab needs user/user/read. When the box is ticked every colour is copied for the user into llx_user_param (flag OBLYON_USER_COLORS = 1, full snapshot pre-filled with the instance values, format checked, dol_set_user_param), the CSS revision is bumped and the page redirects (PRG); unticking removes the flag and every personal colour. The theme reads every colour through the new oblyon_color_setting() (lib/oblyon_colors.lib.php): the personal value when the flag is set and the value is a colour, else the instance value; pages without a user (login, password) keep the instance colours. A contrast warning (same 21 couples as the preset cards) is shown under the table when the personal palette has couples below 4.5. Made for colour-blind or visually impaired users
- Labels for THEME_ELDY_TOPMENU_BACK1, THEME_ELDY_VERMENU_BACK1, THEME_ELDY_BACKBODY and THEME_ELDY_TEXTTITLELINK (read by the theme, never offered before)
- Permission "Set his own personal colours" (oblyon / usercolors, id 4325730) declared by the module: the Colors tab of the user card is shown (tab condition) and reachable (page guard) only with it; granted to the administrators at activation, to the others through the Permissions tab or a group. Disable / enable the module once to register the new tab condition
- Colour presets on the Colors tab of the user card: the five Oblyon presets and the new "Oblyon Accessibility" preset (presets/accessible.json, meta "scope": "user" = offered on this tab only, never on the Colors tab of the module; light background, Okabe-Ito palette readable by colour-blind people, every text / background couple above 4.5), each with "Apply to my colours" (colours only, full snapshot of the 116 constants, personal colours switched on); the user can save the colours shown as a personal preset (documents/oblyon/userpresets/<id>/<key>.json, colours only, visible to him only, download and delete on the card). New library functions oblyon_user_presets_dir / oblyon_get_user_presets / oblyon_get_presets_for_user / oblyon_preset_user_colors / oblyon_user_current_colors / oblyon_apply_preset_to_user / oblyon_save_user_preset / oblyon_delete_user_preset / oblyon_print_user_preset_cards (lib/oblyon_colors.lib.php), shared card preview oblyon_preset_card_preview() (lib/oblyon_presets.lib.php)

### Fixed
- infrassearch breadcrumb dropdown (themeoblyon/modules/infrassearch.inc.php): the hovered entry took the main colour of the preset as text colour and vanished when that colour is dark (instance preset infras-dark: #303030); the hovered row now uses the row hover background and the line text colour of the preset, like lists
- New themeoblyon/modules/mbicalls.inc.php: the calls dropdown of the mbicalls module (its stylesheet hard-codes white rows, navy texts and light pills) now follows the theme tokens (row / hover / text / link / border / neutral backgrounds / action buttons) so it matches the current preset and the personal colours; the semantic state colours (answered, missed, transferred...) are kept
- Audit of the 3.6.0 features: imported preset values are validated by type (colours, numbers, on/off, free text without markup or quotes, custom CSS without '<') and the admin colour fields escape their value (a crafted JSON could store markup shown to every admin); "Update this preset" with a partial section list keeps the other sections; preset files are written atomically (.tmp + rename) after an is_writable() check; the current-preset detection runs once per session; preset keys reject a trailing newline; #RGB previews; line breaks in the name tooltip; a database error while applying gets its own message. Colours per user: an empty field keeps the instance value ('' = auto contrast) instead of storing '#'; the tab honours the historical THEME_ELDY_ENABLE_PERSONALIZED user flag and clears it when unticked; only 6-digit hex is accepted; 'r,g,b' values are accepted only for the constants the theme normalizes; the page initialises the user card hook contexts. Theme: .alilevel0 (jmobile menu) uses the line text / background tokens (was unreadable with Night); a PHP notice in the auto-contrast of the title text removed
- Colors tab, Tabs group: THEME_ELDY_BACKTABCARD1 (background of the active tab of a card) was not offered, so it stayed white in a dark preset with a near-white tab label; it now has its row and its label
- Login page with "login form on the right" (MAIN_LOGIN_RIGHT): the card sat near the top since 3.4.1 (padding-top 12vh had replaced the former margin-top 30vw); it is back under the middle of the screen as before, with an offset computed on the screen height (55vh, the equivalent of 30vw on a 16:9 screen) and capped so that 420px stay for the card on a low window
- css/oblyon.css and css/font.css are now served through css/oblyon.css.php and css/font.css.php (module descriptor): the address no longer ends with .css, so Dolibarr appends its lang / theme / revision parameters as it already does for custom.css.php. A bare address was kept one month by the public cache of Apache and then by Cloudflare, and a modified stylesheet stayed invisible whatever the browser refresh (preset cards broken on the Colors tab after the 3.6.0 update, 2026-09-17).
- Preset cards (Colors tab of the module and of the user card): the Download button showed the icon and the "Download" label, which overflowed the button in the two-button row; the button now shows the icon only (its title already carries the full label, OblyonPresetDownload).

### Changed
- themeoblyon/style.css.php, global.inc.php, info-box.inc.php: the 121 colour reads go through oblyon_color_setting() instead of getDolGlobalString(); the 13 THEME_ELDY_* lines that already tested the user param THEME_ELDY_ENABLE_PERSONALIZED keep that behaviour (the helper honours the historical flag). Generated CSS unchanged for a user without personal colours (checked by diff)
- style.css.php no longer writes THEME_ELDY_ENABLE_PERSONALIZED = 1 as a global constant on every stylesheet request (a DELETE + INSERT on llx_const for nothing: the tests read the user param, never the global). The value seeded by data.sql stays, nothing depends on it
- The five module presets pass the WCAG 4.5 contrast check on every text / background couple the theme paints (versions 2 of the JSON files): action buttons a shade darker (#0072AD for Blue, Green, Night; #006F8A for Dark, Light), title band of Dark and Green a shade darker (#006F8A) with white title text, white title text on the red band of Light, dark green text (#0B2E1A) on the bright green side menu of Green, Dark hover / autocomplete backgrounds #006F8A; Night is now fully dark as its description says (rows #4A4A4A / #3F3F3F, inputs #333333, active tab #444444, text #ECECEC, links #9CCBFF) - its list rows, inputs and active tab were light before, with a near-invisible active tab label and dark links on dark cards. Two theme rules that painted text outside the title band with the title text colour (edit pencil on hover, level 0 of category trees) now use the current text colour, so a white title text stays readable everywhere (themeoblyon/global.inc.php). The contrast check itself was realigned on the theme (text on rows and inputs, links on rows and cards, tab text on the active tab, page title on the page background): 21 couples instead of 16
- Colors tab: the "theme" GET link and its special case in the generic update block are gone (the block first rewrote every color with '#' before applying the preset); the preset thumbnails row of the colors table is replaced by the cards above the form

### [3.5.0] - Compatibility 18.0.x - 24.0.x (2026/09/15)

### Added
- Mobile layout (Menus tab, option "Mobile layout" = OBLYON_MOBILE_LAYOUT, on by default): below 600px of screen width - the width decides, not the user agent, so it also works in a narrowed desktop window - and whatever the menu mode chosen for the desktop, the page gets a single fixed 48px top bar (menu button, logo, login block icons, full width dropdowns) and the main menu becomes an off-canvas drawer: company name, search form and bookmarks, then every module on a 48px row with its icon and label and, behind a chevron, the whole tree of its sub-menus as an accordion (the tree already built for the flyout effect of 3.4.0, now printed whenever the mobile layout is on; the current module and the branch of the current page are unfolded on the first opening; links keep navigating). Overlay, close button and Escape key close the drawer; the side bar is collapsed and the content takes the whole width. New files themeoblyon/mobile.inc.php (CSS, breakpoints 600/900px, tokens --oblyon-mobile-bar-h / --oblyon-touch-target / --oblyon-mobile-gutter) and drawer logic in js/oblyon.js; the flyout positioning and the touch toggles stand aside while the drawer is active. Disable the option to get the previous phone behaviour back (slide menu + sub-menus in the top bar)
- Mobile layout, cards: below 600px the banner becomes navigation on top, photo + reference side by side, status under (never sticky), the tabs form one strip that scrolls with the finger, the key / value tables (tableforfield, tableforfieldcreate, tableforfieldedit) show each field on two lines (label above, value under), the action buttons are stacked full width (44px high, never sticky) and the "more actions" list opens over the bottom of the screen; below 900px the two halves of a card stack in one column and the action buttons wrap
- Mobile layout, lists: below 600px the table scrolls horizontally inside its frame (global.inc.php unsets the overflow of the frame for every screen, restored there) with the first column pinned (page color under the stripe of the row, ellipsis at 45% of the screen), cells stay on one line (long texts cut with an ellipsis at 60% of the screen), the filter row is folded behind a "Filters" button inserted above the table by js/oblyon.js (unfolded from the start, with the count, when a filter is set), the mass-action bar and the title pagination wrap, rows are a little taller and checkboxes bigger for the finger
- Mobile layout, forms and dialogs: below 600px the fields of the create / edit tables (inputs, selects, textareas, select2, CKEditor) take the whole width (short fields - dates, amounts, hours - keep their size), text at 16px so iOS no longer zooms on focus, Create / Cancel side by side on the whole width and 44px high; jQuery UI dialogs (confirmations, popups) become a bottom sheet on the whole width with stacked full-width buttons (tooltip dialogs untouched), the datepicker and select2 lists fit the screen, jNotify notifications span the width under the bar
- Mobile layout, cards: the object lines table (#tablelines) and any table with 6 columns or more get a 640px minimum width inside their scrolling frame instead of squeezing every column; the documents block of the cards (table.liste.formdoc) is excluded from the list rules (pinned column, one-line cells)
- Mobile layout, fix: select2 lists opened on a phone took the whole screen and could not be closed - the core gives the select2 dropdown the "ui-dialog" class (ajax.lib.php), so the bottom-sheet rules of the dialogs applied to them; select2 lists are now excluded from those rules
- Mobile layout, cards: the tabs grouped by the core under "+N" (a phone user agent is limited to one visible tab, whatever the "maximum tabs" option) join the scrolling strip as ordinary tabs; the description column of the object lines keeps 320px (global.inc.php shrank it to 150px below 767px, leaving the description editor 136px wide) and the CKEditor tools hidden by the theme below 768px are back on phones (buttons wrap on several rows, the format / font / size combos stay hidden)
- Mobile layout, dashboard and login: below 600px the dashboard tiles and widgets are in one column (widgets scroll horizontally inside their box, stats boxes two per row), the login page is one card on the whole width with the logo above the fields, 44px fields and button; dashboard tiles are flex rows (the icon column follows the height of the content)
- Mobile layout, fix: a blank area as tall as the window scroll appeared under the content of the cards - the horizontal overflow guard was set on html and body at once, so body (100% high in the theme) became a second scroll container; the guard now sits on html only and body keeps a visible overflow and an automatic height
- Mobile layout, polish: page titles no longer wrap word by word (the right cell of the title table only takes what it needs), same gutters between the blocks of a card, badges centered on their line, a visible press on rows, buttons, tabs and drawer entries, slightly tighter dashboard tiles
- Theme rule hiding every CKEditor tool except "maximize" below 768px removed (commented out in global.inc.php): with the mobile layout the editor has a readable width and the toolbar wraps on several rows

- Options tab, CKEditor section: "WYSIWYG editor skin" (FCKEDITOR_SKIN) - the skins found in the CKEditor directory of the instance (public/includes for Dolibarr 24 and above, includes before; only directories with an editor.css), shown only when there is a choice (several skins, CKEditor engine); a warning tells when the saved skin does not exist (the editor then stays invisible). Seeded to moono-lisa (a line already set by another module is kept)

### Changed
- While the mobile layout is on, the "small screen" flag of the core (set from the browser user agent, whatever the screen width) no longer drives the theme nor the menu manager (slide-menu button, sub-menus moved to the top bar, flyout effect disabled): a phone or a tablet held in landscape gets the desktop layout, and only the width switches to the drawer
- Module JS files are declared with the module version in their address (oblyon.js?v=3.5.0): the server caches .js files for 30 days and browsers kept the previous script after an update

### Changed
- Visual base of the theme modernised for every color preset, without any new option (colors keep coming from the constants): design tokens in :root (radius derived from THEME_ELDY_BORDER_RADIUS, 3 shadow levels, neutral greys computed from the preset line background / text colors, focus color = main color, single transition); cards (div.tabBar, table.noborder, popups, photo) with rounded corners and a light shadow instead of a fixed grey frame; card tabs with a 3px accent line on the active tab, rounded top corners and no more text-shadow (duplicated tab and action-bar definitions removed); form fields with a thin complete border, theme radius, focus ring in the main color (mouse and keyboard, :focus-visible) and checkboxes/radios in the main color (accent-color), select2 aligned; buttons with a single radius, soft shadow on hover only, no more blue/pink inset reflections, refused buttons flat and neutral; badges as pills, border-only status badges on the preset line colors; messages (info/warning/error) as rounded cards, flat tooltips on the theme colors (--tooltipbgcolor was declared but never used), dropdowns and notifications on the shared shadows; dashboard tiles (info-box, boxstats) as uniform cards (no more 6px left bar, single-corner radius nor 3px top line: $borderwidth 3 -> 1); login page card vertically centered (no more margin-top 30vw), soft shadow, visible focus, background driven by OBLYON_COLOR_LOGIN_BCKGRD (constant existed but had no effect) with a title color adapted to it; typography: system font stack as fallback behind the chosen font ("System font" entry added to the font list), headings scaled from the theme font size, line-height 1.45 in the content area, antialiased smoothing; lists: one compact density on every page (cell padding 5px 8px, row line-height 1.5em, header height 34px) instead of five different ones, neutral separators from the preset, page title slightly larger, pagination on the tokens, hard-coded green (#3c6) of totals removed

### Fixed
- Invalid CSS values #8888 (jNotify shadow) and #ffff (dropdown arrow) replaced
- Autofill background (#FDFFF0) now follows the input background color

### [3.4.0] - Compatibility 18.0.x - 24.0.x (2026/09/15)

### Added
- Flyout sub-menus: third opening effect of the reduced left menu (Menus tab, inverted menus + "Reduced left menu", OBLYON_EFFECT_REDUCE_LEFTMENU = flyout, next to "Deployed at mouse-over" and "Do not deploy"). The top bar no longer holds any menu entry (only the logo, the search and the login block). Hovering an icon of the side bar opens a panel on its right with the whole sub-menu tree of the module (levels 1 to 3, nested panels for entries with children). Every link is kept (the icon still leads to the module home page). Works with the sticky side bar and with the touch mode (tap-to-toggle); ignored on phones and when the left menu is hidden. Panels use the left menu colors and the main color (rounded corners, fade-in, accent bar on hover, current page highlighted, chevron on entries with children)

### Changed
- Menus tab: the opening effect of the reduced left menu now uses its own label (OpenEffectReduce) instead of the hidden left menu one

### Fixed
- Left menu built in silent mode (`$noout`) no longer prints the "show left menu" button nor the company name

### [3.3.1] - Compatibility 18.0.x - 23.0.x (2026/07/23)

### Fixed
- Action button dropdown menu (multi-choice buttons, e.g. propal card "Create order/intervention/contract/invoice"): `.dropdown-holder` selector was missing its leading dot and never applied, and `.dropdown-content` had no default anchor below the button (both present in eldy) - the menu could end up positioned over the "Linked files" / "Last events" blocks instead of right under the button
- Sticky action bar option (FIX_ABSOLUTE_BUTTONS_ACTION_CARD): the forced upward-opening override was missing the matching transform, so the menu stayed anchored at the top of the button and extended downward over the content below instead of opening upward

### [3.3.0] - Compatibility 18.0.x - 23.0.x (2026/07/16)

### Added
- Color options for the product autocomplete highlighted row (select2 and jQuery UI "search-to-select")
- Color options for the select2 multi-select fields (tags/categories): background and text of the selected tags shown in the field, and of the already-selected options in the drop-down list

### Changed
- Buttons CSS consolidated into a dedicated file (btn.inc.php); theme values exposed through :root CSS variables
- Initial data (data.sql) made exhaustive, with "Oblyon Blue" as the default preset
- Some theme-specific constants migrated to the standard Dolibarr/Eldy ones (font family, font size, sticky top bar, action button, line hover, main title text, kanban view)

### Fixed
- Inverted sticky top menu (MAIN_MENU_INVERT + sticky): when the bar wraps onto several lines, the content below is no longer hidden behind it (offset now follows the real bar height)
- Autocomplete highlighted-row colors were not applied to the jQuery UI autocomplete used by the product search (PRODUIT_USE_SEARCH_TO_SELECT)
- FontAwesome: on module disable, all MAIN_FONTAWESOME_* constants are now cleaned so Dolibarr falls back to its default icon pack
- Theme copy/removal on enable/disable now conditioned on the absence of htdocs/VERSION (skipped on LTS distributions where the theme is pre-installed)
